Project Unicorn + Upwork is an experimental way to work within Project Unicorn. It'll be a way for developers to team up and work on paid software projects together. We'll help developers find projects that match their skillset, and help them team up with other developers to work on those projects. At the moment, the only requirement to work on these paid software projects is to have shipped a project with a team on Project Unicorn. We'll expand the requirements as we find better ways to vet developers on Project Unicorn.

We started Project Unicorn with a single goal in mind, to be the place where developers come to team up, grow as developers, and work on meaningful software together. By opening up the opportunity to work on paid software, we look forward to continuing to grow Project Unicorn and continuing that goal.
